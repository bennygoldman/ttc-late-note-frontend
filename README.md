# ttc-late-note-frontend

TTC Late Note is a service for Toronto commuters stymied by delayed subways, streetcars, and buses.

Using data published by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and OpenDataTO, the site takes user input, such as date, time, and transit line, and matches it to documented delays on TTC vehicles. 

The information is used to generate a "late note", detailing the reason and duration for the delay, and asking for forgiveness from the offended party on behalf of the TTC.

*Note: At this time we are unable to verify whether the person creating the note was riding the TTC during the stated delay. Recipients should forgive at their discretion.*

This site was built using React with JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS.

It was [Benny Goldman's](http://www.github.com/bennygoldman) Capstone project for the April 2023 cohort of BrainStation's software engineering bootcamp in Toronto.
